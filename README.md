## General Information

I wanted to make a curated list of bitcoin tools that I have found useful so that other bitcoiners can give them a try if interested. By no means if a technology is not on this list does it mean that I would not endorse it or that it is not a good project. This is simply a list of resources I have researched and found that they are good projects and have been around for a while. Sometimes when you find something that works well you do not try anything new to replace it, I am not actively looking to test and add to this list currently. You could say that this would be a solid stack for any bitcoin user.
